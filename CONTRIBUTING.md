## Issues

A good description of an issue helps us to address it quickly and accurately. Please provide information on browser and OS versions, hardware types in the issue, even if you think those are not relevant. A screenshotthat or short video that captures the issue often helps. Also note that Microverse is a multiuser environment and some bugs and issues may not be as easily reproducible for others. Please consider including your network configuration and other information in your description if you think it is relevant.

## Pull Requests

When you create a pull request, the Microverse core team will work with you and determine if it can be merged. Typically, though, we highly recommend that you make us aware the issue it is trying to solve by making a GitHub issue, discuss with the core team before actually making the pull request.

## Development

The [QuickStart Guide](./docs/QuickStart.md) describes how to set up your development environment.
